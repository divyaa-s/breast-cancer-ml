# breast-cancer-ml
**Introduction**
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment and higher chances of survival. Feature extraction is one of the most important steps in breast cancer detection due to its ability to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. Machine learning has been used extensively in the healthcare industry to improve the accuracy of breast cancer detection. Logistic regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification problems. In this project, we aim to develop a logistic regression model to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer.

**Objective**
Our objective with this model is to 
1. Find out the correlation between cancer radius, texture, perimeter, compactness, etc. and whether the cancer is malignant or benign.
2. Upon finding out their correlation between cancer radius, texture, perimeter, compactness, etc. and whether the cancer is malignant or benign.
3. Find out the correlation between cancer radius, texture, perimeter, compactness, etc and whether the cancer is malignant or benign.
4. Upon finding out their correlation, find the relationship between these variables and whether the cancer is malignant or benign.

**The dataset consists of the following column heads-**

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The columns represent-
Diagnosis- The diagnosis of breast tissues (M = malignant, B = benign)
Radius_mean -mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter.
Texture_mean - standard deviation of gray-scale values
Perimeter-mean-mean size of the core tumor
Smoothness-mean -mean of local variation in radius lengths.
Compactness_ mean-mean of perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
Concavity_mean_mean of severity of concave portions of the contour.
Concave points-mean for number of concave portions of the contour
